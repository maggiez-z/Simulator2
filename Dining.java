//Simulator 2 Operating Systems

//There are 5 philosophers eating & thinking together at a table
//Forks are placed between pairs of philosophers (5 forks)
//They need the fork to the right and left of them to eat
//Forks can only be held by one person at a time
//After eating they must put down the fork so that others can eat
//Infinite amount of food exists
//Challenge is to create a concurrent algorithm so that everyone can alternate between eating and thinking
